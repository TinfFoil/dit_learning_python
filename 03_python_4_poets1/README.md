# Module 2. Python for Poets, first part

This is the second session of the 2022 edition of DIT introduction to Python.

The pdf file on top (produced with the [Latex](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) file, also included on top) contains the few slides for this session, including the link to the notebook. The txt file is our *corpus* for the session.

You can download the notebook from here or import it on [colab](https://colab.research.google.com), as we did in the previous session. 

The video-lesson from the first edition (different from the current one) is available [on youtube](https://youtu.be/AId7nQGZ-Sc).
