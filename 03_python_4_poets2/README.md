# Module 2. Python for Poets, second part

This is the third session of the 2022 edition of DIT introduction to Python.

No slides for this session, only a jupyter notebook which you can download from here or copy from
[colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rkZvZ_A4XjQHh3w3-nlBLzB0EuSZlYO4?usp=sharing). The same genesis file as in the previous session is necessary.
The video-lesson from the last edition (slightly different from this one) is available [here](https://youtu.be/AbjNpZZOcf8)
