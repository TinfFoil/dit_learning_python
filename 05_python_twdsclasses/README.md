# Module 5. Into classes

This is the fifth session of DIT's introduction to Python, first covered within PBR 2023.

No slides for this session, only a jupyter notebook which you can download from here or import into 
[colab](https://colab.research.google.com). The same genesis file as in the previous session is necessary.
